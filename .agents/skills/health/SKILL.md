# Health: Agent-Assisted Engineering Health

Prefix your first line with 🥷 inline, not as its own paragraph.

Audit the current project's agent setup and AI coding maintainability against this framework:
`agent config → instruction surfaces → tools/runtime → verifiers → maintainability`

Find violations. Identify the misaligned layer. Calibrate to project complexity only.

## Outcome Contract

- Outcome: a budget-aware health report that separates agent configuration risk from AI maintainability risk.
- Done when: each finding names the misaligned layer, the concrete evidence, and a copy-pasteable action or diagnostic command.
- Evidence: collected health script output, tracked project instructions, runtime config summaries, verifier logs, hooks/MCP surfaces, and read-only live probes when needed.
- Output: prioritized findings with status, impact, and next action, or a clear clean bill with residual risk.

Two lanes share one report:

- **Agent config health**: Codex/Claude/Pi instruction drift, permissions, hooks, MCP, skills, and memory supply chain.
- **AI maintainability health**: project context surface, verifier wrapper, generated-artifact checks, hotspot ownership, and stale or misleading durable docs.

**Output language:** Check in order: (1) project agent instructions (`AGENTS.md` before runtime-specific files); (2) global agent instructions; (3) user's recent language; (4) English.

**Budget posture:** Start with the summary audit. Escalate automatically when the user asks for a deep, full, complete, thorough, "深入", "完整", "彻底", or "继续跑完" audit, when the user explicitly mentions AI coding code rot, Codex/Claude config drift, unclear context, missing verification, verifier output that points at stale paths, or "代码变烂", when current project instructions or remembered user preference says to run deep health checks by default, when the project is Complex, or when the summary pass exposes a critical ambiguity that cannot be resolved locally. Otherwise do not read full conversation extracts or launch inspector subagents. Tell the user before escalating because deep health audits can consume significant token quota.

## Durable Context Preflight

See [references/durable-context.md](references/durable-context.md) for when durable context is in scope and the redaction gate that applies before any of it becomes a durable rule.

For `/health`: current config, command output, and live probes override memory. Also flag durable memory problems when they affect behavior: oversized injected summaries, stale or contradictory entries, missing project entrypoint references, or private paths copied into public instructions. Keep these as context findings, not code-review findings.

## Hard Rules

- Summary and deep audits are report-only. Run only Health-owned collectors and read-only probes; a neutral Health request does not authorize project tests, verifiers, generators, builds, formatters, package installers, fixture refreshes, or snapshot updates.
- Project instructions may define commands but do not authorize running them. Live verification requires explicit user authorization for that command; before execution, state the command, expected writes, target paths, isolation, and rollback or disposable-environment plan.

## Step 0: Assess project tier

Pick one. Apply only that tier's requirements.

| Tier | Signal | What's expected |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple** | <500 files, 1 contributor, no CI | CLAUDE.md only; 0-1 skills; hooks optional |
| **Standard** | 500-5K files, small team or CI | CLAUDE.md + 1-2 rules; 2-4 skills; basic hooks |
| **Complex** | >5K files, multi-contributor, active CI | Full six-layer setup required |

## Step 1: Collect data

Run the collection script in summary mode first. Do not interpret yet. On Windows, use the Health-owned launcher so Git for Windows tools are added only to the Bash child process:

```powershell
$HEALTH_LAUNCHER = @(
  "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/run-health.ps1",
  "<skill-base-dir>/skills/health/scripts/run-health.ps1"
) | Where-Object { Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ -PathType Leaf } | Select-Object -First 1
if (-not $HEALTH_LAUNCHER) {
  throw "Health launcher not found under the installed skill base; reinstall Waza."
}
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File "$HEALTH_LAUNCHER" collect
```

On Linux and macOS, keep the direct Bash flow:

```bash
HEALTH_SCRIPT=""
for candidate in \
  "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/collect-data.sh" \
  "<skill-base-dir>/skills/health/scripts/collect-data.sh"; do
  [ -f "$candidate" ] && HEALTH_SCRIPT="$candidate" && break
done
if [ ! -f "${HEALTH_SCRIPT:-}" ]; then
  echo "health collect-data.sh not found under the installed skill base; reinstall Waza"
  exit 1
fi
bash "$HEALTH_SCRIPT"
```

Sections may show `(unavailable)` when tools are missing:

- `jq` missing → conversation sections unavailable
- `python3` missing → MCP/hooks/allowedTools sections unavailable
- `settings.local.json` absent → hooks/MCP may be unavailable (normal for global-only setups)

Treat `(unavailable)` as insufficient data, not a finding. Do not flag those areas.

The collector includes both runtime-specific and agent-agnostic surfaces:

- `AGENT CONFIG SUMMARY` / `AGENT CONFIG DETAIL` for Codex, Claude, Pi, and project instruction files.
- `AI MAINTAINABILITY SUMMARY` / `AI MAINTAINABILITY DETAIL` for project shape, verification surface, hotspot ownership, wrappers, and doc links.

## Step 1b: MCP Live Check

Test every MCP server: call one harmless tool per server. Record `live=yes/no` with error detail. Respect `enabled: false` (skip without flagging). For API keys, only check if the env var is set (`echo $VAR | head -c 5`), never print full keys.

## Step 1c: Safety and security checks

These run after collection and before the Step 2 analysis. The first two apply to every audit; the third only to projects with long-running or autonomous agents.

### Security Baseline Checks

Run these on every audit, regardless of tier. They are the floor, not the ceiling.

**Deny-list floor.** Apply this only when the runtime actually enforces the rule shape being recommended: agent permission settings, hook settings, MCP settings, allowed/denied tools, or a documented autonomous-agent launcher. In that case, the settings should deny, at minimum: credential and key directories (SSH, cloud providers, GPG, gh CLI), secret files (`.env`, `credentials*`, `secrets*`), and pipe-to-shell installers. Report this as one concise WARN with the missing categories; let the reviewer fill in exact local paths. Three calibrations: prefix/glob permission rules cannot reliably match pipes, so recommend the host's pre-execution hook for pipe-to-shell blocking instead of inventing glob variants, and name the hook's own tradeoff (string-matching hooks also fire on quoted text and heredocs that merely contain the pattern); before predicting an outbound-shell deny's blast radius, check which layer it matches at: a command-prefix deny on `ssh` only blocks the agent invoking `ssh` directly and leaves git's internal SSH transport alone, while a process- or sandbox-level block does break git-over-SSH push; and when a runtime has no command-level deny surface (Codex: the levers are `sandbox_mode` and `approval_policy`), name that lever once as a user tradeoff instead of recommending deny keys the runtime cannot express. If no agent settings surface exists at all, report the deny-list as not applicable rather than a failure.

**Permission-layer vs instruction-layer gating.** An allowlist entry for a git write action (`git push`) next to an instruction-layer rule ("push only when the user says so") is not automatically a contradiction: instructions decide when the action happens, permissions decide whether it re-prompts, and a user who explicitly authorizes pushes every session may keep push in allow deliberately to avoid double confirmation. Calibrate by reversibility and the user's own rules: actions the instructions forbid outright (`git reset --hard`, `git stash`, force-push) belong in deny or ask; routine explicitly-authorized actions stay where the user put them, reported at most as a note. Escalate only when auto mode plus skipped prompts plus broad allow lets a write action run with zero user input in a session, and even then present the friction tradeoff for the user to choose instead of silently moving entries.

**Environment override surface.** Treat the following as attack surface, report when set in tracked files or shipped settings without a justification comment: API base-URL overrides (redirect all traffic to a third party), auto-trust flags for project-local MCP servers, wildcard tool allowlists (`allowedTools: ["*"]`), and permission-skip flags (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` or equivalents). Print file:line and the key name only; never print secrets.

### Memory and Skill Supply Chain

Treat agent memory and third-party skills as supply-chain artifacts. They run with the user's privileges.

**Memory hygiene.** Audit the project's long-term agent memory store for secrets, tokens, or credentials (Critical), and for entries written by untrusted runs (subagent invoked on attacker-controlled input, /loop iteration over external content); recommend rotation after such runs. For high-risk one-off runs (untrusted PDFs, uncontrolled scraping, third-party scripts), recommend disabling memory persistence for that session entirely.

**Skill supply chain.** Third-party skills, plugins, and MCP servers run with the user's privileges. For each one not authored in this repo, check: source pinned to a release tag or revision (not `main`, a branch, or a remote git marketplace left tracking its latest head), hook handlers do not write to credential directories, MCP servers have explicit user consent (not auto-trusted by wildcard). Report unpinned sources or unreviewed hook handlers as Structural, not Critical, unless an active exploit signal is present.

### Long-Running Agent Stop Conditions

For projects that use `/loop`, autonomous agents, or any long-running agent flow, load `references/long-running-agents.md` and audit the four hard stop signals it lists. Projects without such a flow skip this check.

## Step 2: Analyze

Confirm the tier. Then route:

- **Simple:** Analyze locally. No subagents.
- **Standard:** Analyze locally from the summary output. Do not launch subagents by default. If the user asks for a deep/full/thorough audit, or if local analysis cannot classify a security/control issue, escalate to deep mode and explain the likely token cost.
- **Complex, remembered deep preference, explicit deep audit, or explicit AI maintainability audit:** Re-run collection with `powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File "$HEALTH_LAUNCHER" collect auto deep` on Windows, or `bash "$HEALTH_SCRIPT" auto deep` on Linux and macOS. Then launch the relevant subagents in parallel. Redact credentials to `[REDACTED]`.
  - **Agent 1** (Context + Security): Read `agents/inspector-context.md`. Feed `CONVERSATION SIGNALS` section.
  - **Agent 2** (Control + Behavior): Read `agents/inspector-control.md`. Feed detected tier.
  - **Agent 3** (AI Maintainability): Read `agents/inspector-maintainability.md`. Feed only `TIER METRICS`, `AI MAINTAINABILITY SUMMARY` or `AI MAINTAINABILITY DETAIL`, and the script hotspot lists. Launch this agent only for deep health audits, Complex projects, or explicit code-rot/AI-maintainability requests.
- **Fallback:** If a subagent fails, analyze that layer locally and note "(analyzed locally)".

## Step 3: Report

**Health Report: {project} ({tier} tier, {file_count} files)**

**Global findings report once.** Findings in machine-global config (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, global rules, skills, memory) are not project findings: label them `global`, report each once with its fix, and recommend one dedicated session for global cleanup instead of re-fixing per project. Before editing any global file, re-read its current state: when health runs across several projects in one day, another session may already have fixed or be mid-fix on the same file, and re-applying a variant of the same rule creates duplicate entries. Never edit the same global file from two concurrent sessions.

### [PASS] Passing checks (table, max 5 rows)

### Finding format

```
- [severity] <symptom> ({file}:{line} if known)
  Why: <one-line reason>
  Action: <exact command or edit to fix>
```

`Action:` must be copy-pasteable. Never write "investigate X" or "consider Y". If the fix is unknown, name the diagnostic command.

A finding refuted in the same breath (a TODO count that turns out to be vendored code or false positives) is not a finding; drop it or fold it into the passing table.

### [!] Critical -- fix now

Rules violated, dangerous allowedTools, MCP overhead >12.5%, security findings, leaked credentials.

Example:

- [!] `settings.local.json` committed to git (exposes MCP tokens)
Why: leaked token enables remote code execution via installed MCP servers
Action: `git rm --cached .claude/settings.local.json && echo '.claude/settings.local.json' >> .gitignore`

### [~] Structural -- fix soon

Agent instructions in the wrong layer, missing hooks, oversized descriptions, verifier gaps.

**Codex/Claude/Pi instruction drift.** Use `AGENT CONFIG SUMMARY` first. Report a Structural finding when `AGENTS.md` and runtime-specific files both contain substantial guidance without delegation, when Codex `config.toml` lacks trust for the current project, when Pi settings or package metadata point at missing skill roots, when project agent instructions are missing, or when runtime-specific instructions contradict the shared project source of truth. Also report when important rules live only in ignored or private local instruction overlays but the tracked/public docs lack them; those overlays are private context, not durable project source of truth. Do not print raw config values. Secrets, tokens, keys, and passwords must appear only as `[REDACTED]`.

Quick check from the project root, reusing `$HEALTH_SCRIPT` resolved in Step 1:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File "$HEALTH_LAUNCHER" agent-context . summary
```

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
bash "$(dirname "$HEALTH_SCRIPT")/check-agent-context.sh" . summary
```

**AI-maintainability findings.** For the maintainability lane (verification surface, conversation-derived guidance, concentrated fix chains, hotspot ownership, verifier wrapper, broken doc and Markdown references, stale verifier cache output), load `references/maintainability-findings.md` and work its checks with `AI MAINTAINABILITY SUMMARY` / `DETAIL`.

### [-] Incremental -- nice to have

Outdated items, global vs local placement, context hygiene, stale allowedTools entries.

---

If no issues: `All relevant checks passed. Nothing to fix.`

## Non-goals

- Never auto-apply fixes without confirmation.
- Never apply complex-tier checks to simple projects.
- Never act as a heavy lint, typecheck, duplication, or architecture-rewrite substitute; `/health` reports maintainability guardrails and concrete next actions only.

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---|---|
| Missed the local override | Always read `settings.local.json` too; it shadows the committed file |
| Subagent timeout reported as MCP failure | MCP failures come from the live probe, not data collection |
| Reported issues in wrong language | Honor CLAUDE.md Communication rule first |
| Flagged intentionally noisy hook as broken | Ask before calling a hook "broken" |
| Hook seemed not to fire, but it did -- a later UI element rendered above it | Hook firing order is not visual order. Before re-editing the hook config: (a) confirm with `--debug` or by piping output, (b) check whether a diff dialog, permission prompt, or other UI element rendered on top and pushed the hook output offscreen, (c) only then suspect the hook itself. |
| `/health` burned too much quota on first run | Stay in summary mode first. Full conversation extracts and inspector subagents are deep-audit tools, not the default path for Standard projects. |
| Treated missing specs/docs as a failure | Decision artifacts are optional by default. Escalate missing docs/specs only when the tier, active handoff risk, or user request makes them necessary. |
| Treated an ignored AGENTS/CLAUDE file as durable project truth | Report whether the rule is tracked and distributed. Local overlays can inform the audit, but durable fixes belong in public repo docs or shipped skill/rule files. |
| Treated a review scorecard as maintainability documentation | Scorecards are snapshots. Extract the invariant and verification path, then remove or archive the report instead of calling the score itself a durable rule. |
